The following principles may help you write better automated tests.
They are excerpts from the [Angry Tests](https://www.yegor256.com/angry-tests.html) book.

[2.1] Keep every test shorter than a dozen lines.

[2.2] Assert only once per test.

[2.3] Assert in every test.

[2.4] Finish every test with an assert.

[2.5] Don't use [assertDoesNotThrow].

[2.6] Don't fail explicitly using [fail].

[2.7] Use irregular input values, instead of `"foo"`.

[2.8] Use different inputs in every test, don't reuse them.

[2.9] Always write failure messages.

[2.10] Don't share any data between tests, never use `setUp` and `tearDown`.

[2.11] Don't define constants (static literals) inside tests.

[2.12] Don't inline constants, assign them to variables first.

[2.13] Don't bypass object interfaces, especially not via Reflection.

[2.14] Name tests as full English sentences starting with a verb, e.g. `buildsHtmlPage`.

[2.15] Never write any comments inside or outside of test methods.

[2.16] Don't assert on behavior not promised by the object's contract.

[2.17] ...

[2.18] Don't test getters, setters, and similar primitive functionality.

[2.19] Don't delete tests, disable them instead.

[2.20] Never test private or protected object methods.

[2.21] Close resources after use, like files and sockets.

[2.22] Don't write feature code that is only used in tests.

[2.23] ...

[2.24] Don't assert on side effects, like logs.

[2.25] Assert on all possible intermediate results.

[2.26] Don't test constructors — they are [code-free] anyway.

[2.27] Clean up before a test, not after it.

[2.28] Don't use mock frameworks, build [fake objects] instead.

[2.29] Don't forgive incorrect behavior, disable the test instead.

[2.30] Aim for [one-statement] tests.

[2.31] Use [Hamcrest].

[2.32] Don't be discouraged from writing bad tests, they're better than nothing.

[2.33] Every time you change the code, add more tests.

[3.1] Classify tests as "fast" (50ms each) and "deep" (integrating everything).

[3.2] Make tests flaky and unstable, then expect bugs to be reported and fixed.

[3.3] Create custom matchers and reuse them in assert statements.

[3.4] Reproduce bugs with the minimum possible scaffolding.

[3.5] Tests must reproduce particular bugs, not successful usage scenarios.

[3.6] Don't assert on unimportant details, don't be pedantic without reason.

[3.7] Invent a DSL and write test stories using it.

[3.8] Use randomizers to generate test data.

[3.9] Don't help your tests; create the most inconvenient environment for them.

[3.10] Don't keep temporary files next to the source code, use a temporary directory.

[3.11] Don't test abstract classes.

[3.12] Don't let tests log anything, keep the log empty.

[3.13] Parameterize tests.

[3.14] Stop tests on timeout, don't let them run forever.

[3.15] Don't sleep for an arbitrary number of seconds, instead wait for an event.

[3.16] When it's necessary to simulate hanging, sleep for a billion seconds.

[3.17] Let different tests test the same part of the feature code.

[3.18] Test whether your objects are thread-safe.

[3.19] Let tests retry when the behavior they are testing is flaky.

[3.20] Use tags to classify tests.

[3.21] Let your testing framework repeat some tests to increase the chance of hitting the bug.

[3.22] In tests for thread-safety, utilize all available CPUs.

[3.23] Run all tests with no Internet connection, they must pass.

[3.24] Don't assert on the details of errors.

[3.25] Keep the scope of try/catch as small as possible.

[3.26] Strictly one test per feature file.

[3.27] Don't use `verify()` from a mock framework.

[3.28] Don't use [PowerMock] or similar frameworks.

[3.29] Don't instantiate objects or call their methods with default arguments.

[3.30] Don't abbreviate, use `curl --silent` instead of `curl -s`.

[3.31] Don't let feature objects do the job of tests — verify inputs and state.

[3.32] Use decorating invariants to catch improper use of objects during testing.

[3.33] Run tests in parallel threads.

[3.34] Every fast test must take less than 100 milliseconds.

[3.35] Don't mock the file system.

[3.36] Make the place with temporary files accessible after the end of the test suite.

[3.37] Don't assert on the content of logs generated by feature code during tests.

[3.38] Use [ephemeral] TCP ports.

[3.39] Don't use inheritance to reuse test tools.

[3.40] Don't be scared of long test classes — they are OK.

[3.41] Don't fix feature code in response to a failing flaky test.

[3.42] Use [maybeslow] or a similar library to diagnose long running tests.

[3.43] Kill long-running tests on timeout.

[3.44] Inline fixtures instead of keeping them in fixture files.

[3.45] Don't keep large fixtures in static files, let tests generate them.

[3.46] Create fixture objects that generate large fixtures at runtime.

[3.47] Keep reference fixtures as static files in the repository.

[3.48] Code duplication in tests is the last problem to fix.

[3.49] Extract test libraries.
